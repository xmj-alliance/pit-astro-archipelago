# Chat PPT Video (Audio version)

Here's the dialog between ChatGPT and an anxious and angry customer.

> User

> Hello, my PowerPoint stopped working, but it was working yesterday. I am feeling so anxious right now. What can I do?

> ChatGPT

> Hey there! Don't sweat itâ€”let's troubleshoot together. First off, have you tried restarting your computer? Sometimes that works like magic. If that doesn't do the trick, we can explore a few other quick fixes.

> User

> I tried restarting the computer, but the app just crashed itself and refused to open.

> ChatGPT

> That's frustrating! Let's try a couple more things. Have you checked for any updates for PowerPoint? Sometimes a quick update can resolve unexpected issues. If that doesn't work, we might need to dive a bit deeper into the settings or try repairing the installation.
